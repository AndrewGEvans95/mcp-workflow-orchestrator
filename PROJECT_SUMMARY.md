# MCPuppet Project Summary

## What is MCPuppet?

MCPuppet is a **workflow orchestration layer** for MCP (Model Context Protocol) that sits between AI applications and downstream MCP servers. It provides:

- **Policy Enforcement**: Ensures tools are called in the correct order
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all tool calls and workflow activities  
- **Workflow Templates**: Predefined sequences for common operations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status tracking and progress monitoring
- **Compliance Reporting**: Detailed audit reports for governance

              Policy Engine + Audit Trail
```

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Policy Enforcement
- Sequential dependencies (Tool A before Tool B)
- Parallel restrictions (tools that can't run together)
- Conditional execution (Tool C only after Tool A succeeds)
- Approval gates (manual approval required)

### üìä Comprehensive Audit Trail
- Every tool call logged with timestamps
- Success/failure tracking with detailed error messages
- Policy violation detection and reporting
- Session-based tracking for workflow correlation

### üéØ Workflow Templates
- **Customer Onboarding**: validation ‚Üí processing ‚Üí backup ‚Üí notification
- **Financial Processing**: fraud check ‚Üí approval ‚Üí processing ‚Üí audit
- **Data Pipeline**: validation ‚Üí processing ‚Üí monitoring
- **Emergency Response**: immediate notification with approval bypass

### üîç Real-time Monitoring
- Live workflow status tracking
- Progress indicators and completion rates
- Performance metrics (duration, success rates)
- Interactive dashboard for workflow visibility

## Value Propositions

### For Enterprises
- **"Show me exactly what our AI did and prove it followed our policies"**
- **"Prevent AI from doing dangerous things in the wrong order"**
- **"Audit compliance for AI tool usage"**

### For Developers
- **"I can see the full workflow trace when things go wrong"**
- **"I can enforce business logic without changing every tool"**
- **"I can gradually add workflow rules without breaking existing tools"**

### For AI Safety
- **"AI can't accidentally skip safety checks"**
- **"Dangerous tool combinations are blocked by policy"**
- **"Complete audit trail for accountability"**

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **MCPuppet Core** (`orchestrator.py`)
   - Acts as MCP server to AI applications
   - Acts as MCP client to downstream servers
   - Enforces policies and maintains state

2. **Policy Engine** (`workflow_policies.py`)
   - Defines and enforces workflow rules
   - Handles dependencies and restrictions
   - Manages approval workflows

3. **Audit Monitor** (`audit_monitor.py`)
   - Comprehensive logging of all activities
   - Performance tracking and metrics
   - Compliance reporting

4. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`)
   - JSON-RPC interface for Claude Desktop
   - Tool registration and call handling
   - Response formatting for AI consumption

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.9+**: Core implementation
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous operation handling
- **httpx**: HTTP client for downstream servers
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: MCP protocol implementation
- **Rich**: Console output formatting

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Customer Onboarding
```python
# Execute complete workflow
result = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(
    template="customer_onboarding",
    session_id="customer_123",
    data={"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
)
```

### 2. Policy Enforcement Testing
```python
# This will be blocked by policy
await orchestrator.call_tool("session_1", "process_data", {})
# Must call validate_data first
await orchestrator.call_tool("session_1", "validate_data", {})
await orchestrator.call_tool("session_1", "process_data", {})  # Now allowed
```

### 3. Audit and Compliance
```python
# Generate comprehensive audit report
report = orchestrator.audit_monitor.generate_compliance_report("session_1")
# Shows: tool calls, violations, success rate, timing
```

## Demo Capabilities

The project includes comprehensive demos showing:

1. **Successful Workflow Execution**
2. **Policy Violation Detection**
3. **Approval Workflow Handling**
4. **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard**
5. **Audit Trail Generation**

## Future Enhancements

1. **Web Dashboard**: Real-time workflow monitoring UI
2. **Advanced Policies**: Time-based, conditional, and role-based rules
3. **Integration APIs**: REST API for external systems
4. **Machine Learning**: Predictive workflow optimization
5. **Distributed Architecture**: Multi-node orchestration

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcpuppet.git
   cd mcpuppet
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test standalone**:
   ```bash
   python main.py demo
   ```

3. **Connect to Claude Desktop**:
   - Add MCPuppet to `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Restart Claude Desktop
   - Use natural language to execute workflows

## Project Status

This is a **proof of concept** demonstrating:
- MCP workflow orchestration capabilities
- Policy enforcement for AI tool usage
- Comprehensive audit and compliance features
- Real-time monitoring and reporting

The project successfully shows how to add governance, audit, and policy layers to MCP tool interactions without requiring changes to existing tools or AI applications.
